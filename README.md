My implemenation of A* pathfinding in Python 2.7.

Configuring
===========

If you don't want the default setup, edit board.py and change the following:

1) length to be the max length (x) of the search area defined in the board text file
2) height to be the max height (y) of the search area defined in the board text file
3) board50obs.txt to match the text file you want to be the contents of the board. Edit this text file to add obstacles '7's or clear paths '0's

Running

python search.py
