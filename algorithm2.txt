main loop

while 1:
	if there are no candidates for expansion:
		return failure

	choose a leaf node from open_nodes for expansion by sorting all open_nodes with an evaluation function

	if chosen leaf node contains goal state:
		add leaf node to closed_nodes
		add leaf nodes path cost to closed_nodes_path_cost
		return closed_nodes as solution
	else:
		expand the node
		add the resulting nodes to the search tree	
		add leaf nodes path cost to closed_nodes_path_cost
		add leaf node to closed_nodes

evaluation function

node_total_path_cost + distance between start node and goal node
